# Stage Zero Task â€“ Proline Team Information (Using Python Dictionaries)
The **Stage Zero Task** follows the completion of Modules 1, 2, and 3, covering **Coding Syntax, Data Types, and Data Structures**. As part of the task, we formed a group of at least five members and used either R or Python to structure specific details about each team member.

We were instructed not to use functions, loops, conditionals, or any complex programming concepts. The final output should be a single, well-organized print statement displaying our team information.

## Sub-task 1: Team Formation
We formed a group of five members, all of whom prefer Python. Each member is listed as a collaborator on this GitHub repository.

## Sub-task 2: Choosing a Data Structure
As a team, we selected **Dictionaries** to store and organize our information.

## Sub-task 3: Code Contribution
Each team member contributed a line of code to complete the team information.
